How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs of is one of most important aspects of developing. User stories is one of the best tools for finding these needs. These short narratives help developers stay focused on what the user truly needs and why it matters. Instead of just listing features, user stories help interpret user intent into functional requirements that guide the develpment process. Users usually describe things they believe they need in terms of features or tools, but it is the job of the developer to determine the root problem and problem solve that. This can involve asking the right questions, watching user behavior, and analyzing bottle necks in the current workflow. Once the real need is found, it becomes easier to develop and design solutions that are not just funcitonal.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, I start with identifying and defining the problem as best as possible. From there, I get requirements and requests from user stories if they are available. From there, I start planning the structure of the application. I prefer to develop in small, functional chunks that can be tested along the way. After testing, I work on refinement and more testing. This approach aligns well with Agile principles and methodologies. As I continue to grow as a developer, I hope to get better at incorporating more Agile methodologies into my workflow. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means more than only writing good code. I have to be an active listener while also communicating clearly and be open to feedback. This involves supporting team memebers, sharing knowledge, and stepping up when the team needs help. A strong team relies on trust and respect, and as a developer, I want to be someone that others can rely on.
